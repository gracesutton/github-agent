# GitHub Issues RAG Agent

## Overview

This project is a Python-based AI agent that can answer questions about a GitHub repository’s issues using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **semantic search**.

Instead of loading all GitHub issues directly into the language model, the system stores them in a **vector database (Astra DB)** and retrieves only the most relevant issues for each query. This makes the agent faster, cheaper, and more accurate.

Each query only incurs cost when invoking the OpenAI API, with usage billed per token rather than per request. All other components (GitHub API access, Astra DB vector retrieval, and local tooling) operate at no cost. By retrieving only the most relevant issues via a vector database, the RAG pipeline significantly reduces prompt size and overall LLM usage, resulting in typical costs of around $0.0002–$0.002 per query.

The agent can also perform simple side effects, such as saving notes to a local file.

## How it works

At a high level, the pipeline looks like this:

1. GitHub issues are fetched via the GitHub REST API
2. Each issue is converted into a LangChain `Document`
3. Issue content is embedded using OpenAI embeddings
4. Embeddings are stored in an Astra DB vector store
5. When a user asks a question:
   * relevant issues are retrieved using semantic similarity
   * the language model generates an answer grounded in those issues

## Agent behaviour

The agent runs as a command-line interface and can:

* Answer questions about any issue in the repository
* Summarise common problems or patterns
* Reference issue metadata such as author and creation date
* Save notes locally using a tool (`note_tool`)

The agent is built using **LangChain v1**, which uses a graph-based execution model rather than the legacy `AgentExecutor`.

Unlike a static RAG pipeline, this system allows the language model to dynamically decide when to invoke tools and chain multiple actions together.

The agent can both:
* retrieve information (semantic search over GitHub issues)
* perform side effects (e.g. persisting notes to disk)

This demonstrates early-stage autonomous, tool-using behaviour.

## Technologies used

* **Python3**
* **LangChain v1.2.8** – agent orchestration and tools
* **OpenAI** – embeddings and GPT-4o mini chat model
* **Astra DB** – vector store for semantic retrieval
* **GitHub REST API** – source of issue data

## Example usage

```text
Ask about GitHub issues: flashing messages not showing
```

The agent will:

* search for semantically related issues
* retrieve the most relevant ones
* generate an answer based only on those issues

## Attribution

This project is a learning-focused implementation intended to explore:

* RAG pipelines
* LangChain v1 agents
* Vector databases
* Tool-using AI systems

It is based on and extends a tutorial by **Tech With Tim** on YouTube: [Python AI Agent Tutorial - Build a Coding Assistant w/ RAG & LangChain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN7X819DUlQ&t=2491s).

The agent retrieves and analyses GitHub issues from a public repository: [techwithtim/Flask-Web-App-Tutorial/issues](https://github.com/techwithtim/Flask-Web-App-Tutorial/issues).
